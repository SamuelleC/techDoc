            <p>
                Variables are used to store data values that can be referenced and manipulated throughout a program. 
                Unlike many programming languages, Python variables do not require an explicit declaration of type, as Python is dynamically typed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Variables can store various data types, such as numbers, strings, lists, or even complex objects. 
            </p>
            <code>
                age = 25 
                decimal = 5.25
            </code>
            <code>
                name = "Alice"
                middleName = 'A'
            </code>
            <hr>

        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
            <header>Declaring Variables</header>
            <p>In Python, declaring variables is straightforward because it does not require explicit type declaration.</p>
            <p>
                Variables are created simply by assigning a value to a name using the = operator, which makes Python highly flexible and beginner-friendly. 
                For example, writing x = 10 assigns the integer value 10 to the variable x.
            </p>
            <code>
                age = 25 
                print("My age is:", age) 
            </code>
            <code>
                name = "Alice"
                greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!"
                print(greeting)
            </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Built-in_Functions">
            <header>Built-in Functions</header>
            <p>Built-in functions are a collection of pre-defined functions that are always available for use, providing essential tools that simplify coding tasks.</p>
            <p>These functions perform common operations, such as data manipulation, mathematical calculations, and input/output handling, without the need to import additional libraries.</p>
            <p>For example the <strong>len()</strong>, <strong>print()</strong>, and <strong>type()</strong> built-in functions.</p>
            <code>
                message = "Hello, Python!"
                print("Message:", message)

                length = len(message)
                print("Length of the message:", length)

                data_type = type(message)
                print("Data type of message:", data_type)
            </code>
